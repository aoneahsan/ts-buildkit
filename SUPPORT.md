## FAQ

### Q: How do I configure the crypto secret?

```typescript
import { configureZTK } from 'ts-buildkit';

configureZTK({
  cryptoSecret: process.env.CRYPTO_SECRET,
});
```

### Q: Why am I getting "cryptoSecret not configured" error?

You need to call `configureZTK()` before using any cryptographic functions.

### Q: Can I use this in the browser?

Yes! ts-buildkit works in both Node.js and browser environments.

### Q: How do I use optional peer dependencies?

Install them separately:

```bash
npm install crypto-js dayjs zod
```

Then import from the require-package path:

```typescript
import dayjs from 'ts-buildkit/require-package/dayjs';
```

### Q: Is TypeScript required?

No, but it's highly recommended. The library works with JavaScript too.

### Q: How do I report security vulnerabilities?

See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md). Email security issues privately.
